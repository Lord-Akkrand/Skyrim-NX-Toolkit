This is where you need to put:
- nvddsinfo.exe <https://github.com/castano/nvidia-texture-tools/releases>
- textconv.exe <https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/releases>
- texdiag.exe <https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/releases>
- ffmpeg.exe <https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-latest-win64-static.zip>

If you don't, then the scripts will attempt to download them.  If that fails, any script requiring one of these will not run.

- bsarch.exe should be in this folder, it is available under MPL.
I downloaded the binary from <https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64745>
The source code is available at <https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/tree/dev/Tools/BSArchive>
