# Unpack Mod

Unpack mod will make a copy of a mod folder and unpack all the bsas from the mod into that folder, and copy across everything else.

## Usage

`UNPACK_MOD.BAT "C:\path\to\mod"`

It expects the folder passed to it contains the "Data" for the mod.  That is, an ESP, INI, BSA files and (optionally) the loose folders (grass/interface/lodsettings/meshes/music/scripts/seq/shadersfx/sound/strings/textures)
